What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

   A new folder is created to save all the history there.
   I need to do it because otherwise, there won't be a directory
   for the versions to be saved.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

   Working directory: it does not have all the same files, only the
   ones you want to be able to commit.
   Repository: it has the commited files, the different versions
   that have been saved.
   I think it allows people to choose the files they want to commit
   even if the directory has more.
